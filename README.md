# Ionic-iBeacon
iBeacon scanner with Ionic 1.3 and cordova-plugin-ibeacon.</br>
This is the test project for upgrading <a href="https://github.com/tinydream12/cordova-plugin-ibeacon">cordova-plugin-ibeacon</a>, all UI and features are the same with <a href="https://github.com/tinydream12/Ionic2-iBeacon">Ionic2-iBeacon</a>.

(*** This is only test app, so.. only can check monitoring(with enter/exit events) and ranging, not works with the UI. ***)
